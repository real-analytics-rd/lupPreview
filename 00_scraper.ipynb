    "\n",
    "1- <b> get_values_matching_regex </b> returns values that match a regex expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;Because the \"Guardian\" website has two possible formats, we defined two possible classifiers for the p tags <br>&emsp;containing the information to be extracted.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;We go through each p section, and if we find the result, we return it; otherwise, a None is returned.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;The result is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a value that matches the regex pattern.<br> &emsp;Unsatisfied patterns for regexes that include <b>OR</b> conditions will be empty tuples. That's why you need to get rid of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- <b> extract_teams_names </b> returns the names of the two teams in a football preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;The preview includes team names at the title level.\n",
    " <br>&emsp;example:\n",
    "          &emsp;&emsp;{{Squad Sheets: Team A v Team B}} \n",
    "         or &emsp;&emsp;{{Team A v Team B: match preview}} \n",

    "<br>&emsp;As a result, our strategy is to delete the text preceding or following the names and recover each name <br>&emsp;individually.\n",
    "<br>&emsp;If we were successful in obtaining the names, they will be returned in a Python dictionary; <br>&emsp;otherwise, the values will be 'n/a'(Not available).\n",
    "\n",
    "3- <b> extract_text_authors </b>returns the text and author of a football preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;It's difficult to determine the position of the text, but it's almost certainly the block with the most <br>&emsp;characters.\n",
    "<br>&emsp;To proceed, we store each paragraph and its size in a Python dictionary, and then we take the <br>&emsp;block with the largest size.\n",
    "<br>&emsp;To be sure, we double-check by only accepting texts with a size greater than 160 because there <br>&emsp;are football previews with no text or author.\n",
    "<br>&emsp;Furthermore, the author information is always under the text section, more specifically in a <br>&emsp;strong tag, so if the text does not exist, the author is missing as well.\n",
    "If we were successful in <br>&emsp;obtaining the text and the author, they will be returned in a Python dictionary. Otherwise, the <br>&emsp;values will be 'n/a'(Not available).\n",
    "\n",
    "4- <b> extract_preview_date </b> returns the date of publication of a football preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;We have distinguished two dates for the date of publication: the first is the date of publication, <br>&emsp;and the second is the date of the most recent modification.\n",
    "In this sense, we go through the <br>&emsp;section where the two dates are located and take only the first and use 'dateparser' to convert <br>&emsp;the string into a date in \"yyyy-mm-dd\" format.\n",
    "If we were successful in obtaining the date, it will <br>&emsp; be returned. Otherwise, the value will be 'n/a'(Not available).\n",
    "\n",
    "5- <b> extract_match_infos </b> returns a football match information (venue, referee, odds).\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;Here, we'll call the first function <b>get_values_matching_regex</b> , which will allow us to retrieve this<br>&emsp;information by specifying a regex expression for each.<br>&emsp;If this data is not available, the value will be 'n/a'. "
