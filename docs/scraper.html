<p>To reach the aim of our project, we have begun the first task, which is to collect football experts' comments and data from English Premier League matches.
<br>For this task, we will use match previews from "The Guardian." It goes back far enough, from 2009 to today, to allow us to integrate deep neural networks.
<br>Indeed, "The Guardian's" football experts publish previews every week, usually two or three days before the matches.
<br>In this regard, we began by creating a data extraction tool that will allow us to extract this information on a regular basis.
<br>The information to be extracted is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names of the competing teams.</li>
<li>The date of the game</li>
<li>The identity of the referee</li>
<li>The stadium's name</li>
<li>Sports odds that will be converted to decimal format</li>
<li>The football expert's text</li>
<li>The text's author.</li>
</ul>

<p>&emsp;In this section, we will calculate the odds derived from the football preview.
<br>&emsp;Considering the following example:
<br>&emsp;&emsp; ["9-20","29-5","6-5"] 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;We calculate each sport's rating separately using the following formula:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; home = (9/20) + 1 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; away = (29/5) + 1
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; draw = (6/5) + 1
<br>&emsp;If we were successful in obtaining decimal odds, they will be returned in a Python dictionary.<br>&emsp;Otherwise, the values will be None (Not available).</p>
<p>2- <b> extract_preview_items </b>returns the entire contents of a football preview.</p>
<p>&emsp;In this section, we will call the functions defined in the PageExtractor class and return a Python dictionary containing all of this information.
<br>&emsp;But first, we use the <b>calculate_betting_odds</b> function to calculate the sports odds for the home team's victory, the away team's victory, and a draw.</p>
<p>"game Id","home team","away team","text","author","venue","referee","odds","odds home team","odds away team","odds draw", "preview date","game Date","preview_link" are the returned values.</p>
<p>3- <b> extract_previews </b> returns the information of all extracted previews.</p>
<p>&emsp;We retrieve all previews for a given page and go through them one by one, taking the link and getting its data using the "Guardian Api."
<br>&emsp;If the "Guardian Api" does not work, we will resort to the traditional process of html parsing. 
<br>&emsp;For each preview in the data extracted from the Guardian, we will look for the id of the home team and the away team and match it with the <b>opta.fixture</b><br>&emsp;database to get the gameID and gameDate and finally we save it in a MongoDb collection.
<br>&emsp;If the game exists, we will proceed with the data extraction.
The previous function, <b>extract_preview_items</b>, will be called here to extract information from <br>&emsp;each 
preview, which will then be stored in the list "all previews."
<br>&emsp;However, we will only extract previews that do not already exist in the database.</p>
