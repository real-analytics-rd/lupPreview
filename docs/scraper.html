<p>&emsp;In this section, we will calculate the odds derived from the football preview.
<br>&emsp;Considering the following example:
<br>&emsp;&emsp; ["9-20","29-5","6-5"] 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;We calculate each sport's rating separately using the following formula:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; home = (9/20) + 1 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; away = (29/5) + 1
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; draw = (6/5) + 1
<br>&emsp;If we were successful in obtaining decimal odds, they will be returned in a Python dictionary.<br>&emsp;Otherwise, the values will be None (Not available).</p>
<p>2- <b> extract_preview_items </b>returns the entire contents of a football preview.</p>
<p>&emsp;In this section, we will call the functions defined in the PageExtractor class and return a Python dictionary containing all of this information.
<br>&emsp;But first, we use the <b>calculate_betting_odds</b> function to calculate the sports odds for the home team's victory, the away team's victory, and a draw.</p>
<p>"game Id","home team","away team","text","author","venue","referee","odds","odds home team","odds away team","odds draw", "preview date","game Date","preview_link" are the returned values.</p>
<p>3- <b> extract_previews </b> returns the information of all extracted previews.</p>
<p>&emsp;We retrieve all previews for a given page and go through them one by one, taking the link and getting its data using the "Guardian Api."
<br>&emsp;If the "Guardian Api" does not work, we will resort to the traditional process of html parsing. 
<br>&emsp;For each preview in the data extracted from the Guardian, we will look for the id of the home team and the away team and match it with the <b>opta.fixture</b><br>&emsp;database to get the gameID and gameDate and finally we save it in a MongoDb collection.
<br>&emsp;If the game exists, we will proceed with the data extraction.
The previous function, <b>extract_preview_items</b>, will be called here to extract information from <br>&emsp;each 
preview, which will then be stored in the list "all previews."
<br>&emsp;However, we will only extract previews that do not already exist in the database.</p>

Beating Manchester City while under the caretaker charge of Mark Hudson would go some way to cheering up the locals and convincing them that relegation is not a certainty. But it is a mighty tall order, with Pep Guardiola’s side in fabulous form as they continue to chase Liverpool at the top of the table.

Newcastle have won only twice at home all season and Benítez hopes their fans will contain understandable anger at the owner, Mike Ashley’s regime. “Cardiff’s game-plan will be to stop us and make sure our fans are nervous and anxious,” said Newcastle’s manager. “My message is very clear: stay together behind our team, keep helping the players. If we want to stay up, we need every single fan behind the players.” Louise Taylor&#39;, &#39;author&#39;: &#39;Louise Taylor&#39;, &#39;venue&#39;: &#39;St James’ Park&#39;, &#39;referee&#39;: &#39;Stuart Atwell&#39;, &#39;odds&#39;: [&#39;1-1&#39;, &#39;10-3&#39;, &#39;12-5&#39;], &#39;odds_home_team&#39;: 2.0, &#39;odds_away_team&#39;: 4.333333333333334, &#39;odds_draw&#39;: 3.4, &#39;preview_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 18, 16, 57, 35, tzinfo=&lt;StaticTzInfo &#39;UTC&#39;&gt;), &#39;game_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 19, 15, 0), &#39;preview_link&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/18/newcastle-cardiff-match-preview&#39;}

Claude Puel is under pressure despite Leicester sitting comfortably in eighth and the chance to earn a third successive away win at the Molineux. Disappointing defeats to Newport County and Cardiff are the source of unrest and Puel’s reliance on Jamie Vardy is a problem. Leicester have won three of the 11 matches Vardy has played in but failed to score. Stopping him is key.

Sean Dyche seems to have stumbled across a purple patch thanks largely due installing Tom Heaton back in goal. Heaton has conceded two goals in four successive Burnley wins since Joe Hart conceded five to Everton. Goals still come at a premium for Dyche though as illustrated by miraculously beating Fulham 2-1 without a single shot on target. Watford will miss Will Hughes through concussion but Troy Deeney has hit form with four goals in six matches.

Cardiff, two places above Saints, have won three of their last four at home.

If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.

Richarlison’s lack of form is a concern though. The Brazilian scored his first goal for Watford against Eddie Howe’s side in August but has failed to find the net since November.

Sam Allardyce has a decent derby record overall but it will require a stunning transformation – from both sides – to trouble Liverpool’s unbeaten home run against their rivals, one that stands at 17 league games.

Seven points from their Turf Moor fixtures to date has been a decent return and Monday night’s comfortable win over Watford gives the Clarets momentum going into Arsenal’s visit. Sean Dyche’s decision to bolster the midfield in the absence of Andre Gray paid off and he is unlikely to deviate from that setup against Arsenal, who have won six matches in seven. Victory would be Burnley’s first in the league against Arsenal for 42 years.

Not exactly roasting but warm enough to discard winter scarves – well unless you are Dick Advocaat.

A game Advocaat could do with winning slightly more than Nigel Pearson.

Leicester won 2-1 at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup in January, but they would trade that for three points in their survival fight.

With neither side yet mathematically safe, a game Di Canio has dubbed &#34;our Champions League final&#34; possesses added edge. It will also be the excellent Danny Rose\&#39;s last match for Sunderland before the on loan left–back – ineligible for next weekend\&#39;s game at White Hart Lane – returns to Tottenham.

This is a &#34;six-pointer&#34; the hosts simply must win and it will not do their brittle confidence much good to know Wigan have won three of their past four games.

Besides, they played well at Liverpool and progressed over the two legs in the Europa League against Inter. Fulham feel that they need three wins to safeguard their Premier League status.

The priority for Michael Laudrup, however, is that his players remain focused and do not let their Capital One Cup success be a precursor to an end-of-season slump. Arriving in south Wales is a Newcastle side that has won three of its last four games and no longer appears consumed with relegations worries. It is a concern for the visitors, though, that their captain, Fabricio Coloccini, is out injured.

The hosts, yet again, find themselves in a relegation battle but will be boosted by their 3-0 win at Reading last week, not to mention the news that Daniel Sturridge is an injury doubt for the visitors.

The Saints manager has denied reports he was issued with an ultimatum this week by the chairman but a fifth successive defeat in all competitions would still be disastrous. Michael Laudrup has told his players to be wary of a motivated side keen to save their manager, although he will be quietly confident of a good performance following his team&#39;s impressive 1-1 draw against Chelsea last weekend. Jack Cork should be fit to make his first appearance of the season, and Southampton fans can welcome the record signing Gastón Ramírez to St Mary&#39;s after he returned from injury to face West Bromwich Albion on Monday. Five of Southampton&#39;s next seven fixtures are at home, the highest placed of these opponents being Newcastle in 10th.

The fixture was already set to be a lively affair, with both Pardew and Sam Allardyce facing their former employers. Allardyce will be keen to seek revenge following his dismissal in 2008, his opposite number being the man Mike Ashley lined up to replace him. Both sides are struggling defensively, which could mean plenty of goals at St James&#39; Park. West Ham wait on fitness tests for James Collins and James Tomkins, while Newcastle are without the suspended duo of Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tioté, Newcastle&#39;s two key defensive players. Their absence gives a boost to the visitors&#39; physical approach, which has not been particularly successful away from home; a 2-1 victory at QPR is their only away success to date. Up against a depleted Newcastle recovering from a midweek trip to Belgium, Allardyce could rectify West Ham&#39;s away form, and make a victorious return.

Paul Lambert&#39;s revolution is making slow but steady progress, his young side&#39;s three-match unbeaten run putting a relatively comfortable four-point buffer between themselves and the relegation zone. Villa are boosted by the return after suspension of Karim El Ahmadi, whose crisp passing has brought some vital composure to an otherwise inexperienced midfield; Villa have held the majority of possession on only two occasions this season. The hosts will need significantly higher ball retention than in recent weeks if they are to stunt a visiting side that seem to be steadily growing in confidence as the season progresses. United have won four successive league games since the shock 3-2 defeat by Tottenham, and with a relatively straight forward run of games until the Manchester derby in early December, Ferguson will be keen to ensure his team do not drop points against sides as depleted as Villa.

Stretched by Europa League involvement, Newcastle have six points fewer than at this stage last season and could do with a win if they are to continue harbouring hopes of Champions League qualification. Much may depend on how young Gaël Bigirimana copes as a deputy for the suspended Cheik Tiote in the home side&#39;s midfield.

Perhaps the most glaring omission for the visitors is that of Tim Krul – the Dutch goalkeeper picked up an elbow injury on Holland duty.

Hughton, however, will be going all out to beat his friend, and much could hinge on the potential success of a new forward partnership between Grant Holt and Robert Snodgrass. With the unsettled forward Clint Dempsey not in the squad, Fulham will be looking to new signing Mladen Petric for goals, whilst Moussa Dembélé remaining at the club is a significant bonus.

Terry Connor&#39;s tenure has realised just two points from 10 games and the irony would be considerable if he finally gets a first win now. Swansea, with only one victory in their last six, have been in holiday mode for some time, but keeping hold of the coveted Brendan Rodgers this summer is now their main concern.

Mark Hughes will be without his French striker Djibril Cissé, who is beginning a four-match ban for another red card, but the Welshman can recall the club&#39;s top scorer Heidar Helguson after a lengthy knee injury.

Arsène Wenger&#39;s side have lost back-to-back league matches for the second time this season and, 15 points off the top, their priority now is not to lose more ground in terms of the Champions League qualification places. United have the best away record in the league but this is also the chance for Arsenal to get August&#39;s 8-2 thrashing at Old Trafford out of their system, or at least soothe some of the wounds.

They do at least have the best home record in the bottom half of the table – four wins and 15 points from 10 matches – the same as Newcastle in away games.

Paul Lambert opted to play with a lone striker that day and Grant Holt gave John Terry such a mauling that it will be intriguing to see what happens if the Norwich manager decides to unleash both Holt and Steve Morison on the still brittle Chelsea defence at the same time. That would be quite a challenge for Gary Cahill, if André Villas-Boas decides to give his £7m new signing from Bolton a debut here. Chelsea, of course, will hope to keep play heading towards the other end and should have enough to prevail in a game that promises goals.

The fragile Sunderland of early season might have offered some respite, but Martin O\&#39;Neill\&#39;s revitalised charges represent a considerable threat. &#34;He\&#39;s had the right kind of impact there,&#34; said André Villas-Boas of his opposite number. &#34;The team were low in motivation and self-belief, but they are now inspired.&#34; Steve Bruce\&#39;s side won 3-0 here last season.

For something similar to happen this time, Roy Hodgson needs more belief from his team than they showed in an inhibited display last weekend against Liverpool. &#34;Too much respect&#34; was the phrase that the manager used. Maximum respect is due to Robin van Persie, who will surely be back in the starting line-up, along with fit-again Thomas Vermaelen.

The Canaries adopted a similar approach at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge earlier this season and although both games ended in defeat for the visitors, the performances were encouraging. Make no mistake, though, this will be tough for the visitors, who are still without their preferred centre-back pairing of Elliott Ward and Zak Whitbread. They will also be facing a virtually full-strength Liverpool with the suspended Lucas Leiva expected to be the only absentee.

Even better for the Newcastle manager, there is strong competition for places in several key positions.

His deputy, Declan Rudd, saved a penalty in Sunday&#39;s 1-0 defeat to West Bromwich, but is likely to revert to the bench.

David Moyes will have his own issues to address over the summer, but will be happier to do so should his team maintain seventh place.

Gérard Houllier, still recuperating from his health scare, is unable to face the club with whom he won six trophies at the start of the century and, given Liverpool have not lost at Villa Park in their last 12 visits, they will be hopeful of pipping Tottenham, who face Birmingham, to fifth place.

That record, which includes the recent 2-1 defeat at Chelsea, adds to the stress of the trip to Anfield, where Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s side has been beaten on its last two visits. The joy of disrupting United&#39;s bid for a record 19th league title would be memorable for Liverpool, who need time to develop their squad before they can expect to compete for major trophies themselves.

Despite an encouraging opening 20 minutes against United last week, Wigan collapsed and now look in serious danger of being relegated. The bottom-placed team have the second-worst attack in the league and need to start scoring if they are to survive.

The caretaker manager Kenny Dalglish has made a good impression with victories in his last three games, but this match will be more revealing about the suitability of making his appointment permanent.

Lose, and the feelgood factor of his return will be replaced by a deepened sense of crisis.

Being forewarned may not be forearmed when it comes to dealing with Andy Carroll, however, and the young striker has the tools to test the solidity of Arsenal&#39;s central defence.

Nobody has managed more than Mark Noble&#39;s two for the Hammers, and he is missing today after appendix surgery.

For Harry Redknapp qualifying for the Champions League play-offs is a reality and Tottenham have no need to fear the lasagne at Turf Moor. Ledley King&#39;s knees are likely to be spared as a result.

Anything else and the championship trophy will be leaving Old Trafford after three years. United are missing the injured Antonio Valencia and it likely to be an eerie atmosphere at Old Trafford. Even so, a home win should be a formality against a Stoke side that sieved seven goals when they played at Chelsea a fortnight ago. &#34;All we can do is hope,&#34; says Sir Alex Ferguson. &#34;But it\&#39;s pointless going into the game expecting anything from Chelsea in our favour.&#34; Daniel Taylor&#39;, &#39;author&#39;: &#39;Daniel Taylor&#39;, &#39;venue&#39;: &#39;Old Trafford, tomorrow 4pm&#39;, &#39;referee&#39;: &#39;M Clattenburg&#39;, &#39;odds&#39;: [&#39;1-8&#39;, &#39;22-1&#39;, &#39;17-2&#39;], &#39;odds_home_team&#39;: 1.125, &#39;odds_away_team&#39;: 23.0, &#39;odds_draw&#39;: 9.5, &#39;preview_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2010, 5, 7, 17, 15, 33, tzinfo=&lt;StaticTzInfo &#39;UTC&#39;&gt;), &#39;game_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2010, 5, 9, 15, 0), &#39;preview_link&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/07/manchester-united-stoke-city-squad-sheets&#39;}

Sunderland have kept one clean sheet in their last nine games, but a rare away win for Steve Bruce&#39;s team could see them finish in the top half of the table, and 25-goal striker Darren Bent will be intent on making a final point to England manager Fabio Capello.

Harry Redknapp&#39;s side are aiming for fourth place and a defeat could leave them facing a winner-takes-all encounter with Manchester City next Saturday. Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown should return for Manchester United, while Aaron Lennon may be in the Spurs squad for the first time this year.

After spending much of his time in east Yorkshire injured, he said: &#34;I owe this club and its fans. I don\&#39;t want to be seen as a peg-leg.&#34; Fulham are not the best travellers but, having lost to Manchester City and Tottenham during the past week, Hodgson will be anxious to avoid a third defeat in the space of seven days.

The 4-1 win at Old Trafford a year ago came in the middle of the current run of three consecutive victories over Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s side. United, however, seem to be finding stability, particularly because the centre-backs Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are both fit once again, although Jonny Evans remains a doubt with a knee injury.

While Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s team is in much better shape now Fulham will be trying to regroup after the 3-1 defeat by Juventus in Turin. They have little time to revitalise themselves. Their sole away win so far in the league came at Portsmouth on the opening weekend.

However, we cannot complain about the consistency the players have shown in the league the last few months.&#34; Gregg Morgan&#39;, &#39;author&#39;: &#39;Gregg Morgan&#39;, &#39;venue&#39;: &#39;White Hart Lane&#39;, &#39;referee&#39;: &#39;S Bennett&#39;, &#39;odds&#39;: [&#39;10-11&#39;, &#39;10-3&#39;, &#39;12-5&#39;], &#39;odds_home_team&#39;: 1.9090909090909092, &#39;odds_away_team&#39;: 4.333333333333334, &#39;odds_draw&#39;: 3.4, &#39;preview_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2010, 2, 26, 19, 48, tzinfo=&lt;StaticTzInfo &#39;UTC&#39;&gt;), &#39;game_date&#39;: datetime.datetime(2010, 2, 28, 13, 0), &#39;preview_link&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/26/squad-sheets-tottenham-hotspur-everton&#39;}

The clubs&#39; obsession with one another has waned since Chelsea became such a concern. Yet the struggle is too tight for decorum to be demonstrated at the Emirates. Arsenal have to show they are more formidable now than when beaten easily there in last season&#39;s Champions League semi-final.

Aston Villa and Tottenham follow in the league for Liverpool and they cannot afford to lose further ground in the pursuit of fourth place.

Arsenal have won their previous six matches and scored four or more in each of their last four home fixtures. Birmingham, on the other hand, have lost four of their last five in the Premier League and not won at Arsenal since 1957. Carson Yeung, Birmingham&#39;s new president, was not even born then.

Wolves, who are boosted by the return of Michael Kightly, Kevin Foley, Jody Craddock and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, need a victory after picking up only one point from their previous three matches.

The derby still has an enhanced status not only because of the sums lavished on the visitors and the fact that Sir Alex Ferguson has disparaged them, but also because City are level with United on points despite having played one game fewer.
