Crystal Palace,Liverpool,"Liverpool have already dispelled most of the doubts about how they would cope while Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané are at the Africa Cup of Nations. They are yet to lose without their star forwards but Jürgen Klopp knows there is no room for error if they are to maintain any hope of reeling in Manchester City. Crystal Palace have lost their past nine league meetings with Liverpool by an aggregate score of 27-5 but will be mightily relieved not to be facing Salah and Mané, as they have contributed 17 of those goals between them. Palace are boosted by Jordan Ayew’s early return following Ghana’s Afcon exit.

Newcastle,Watford,"Moussa Sissoko returns to Newcastle in Watford’s midfield as Claudio Ranieri’s side aim to arrest a run of seven straight defeats in all competitions against a Newcastle side with only one win to their name. Both Eddie Howe and Ranieri accept a draw will not be good enough in a relegation skirmish being dubbed a 12-pointer. Much could hinge on the performance of two forwards, Newcastle’s £25m signing, Chris Wood, and Ranieri’s £3.6m leading scorer, Emmanuel Dennis. After this, 17th-placed Watford face two more of the bottom three in the next week, travelling to Burnley on Tuesday and entertaining Norwich on Friday.

Manchester United,West Ham,"This is a genuine six-pointer in which Manchester United can leapfrog West Ham into fourth if they win, whereas if David Moyes’ side take the spoils they will pull five points ahead of United. After Cristiano Ronaldo drew criticism for his visible unhappiness at being replaced during Wednesday’s win at Brentford there should be no surprise if, neck problem permitting, the 36-year-old sparkles against West Ham.

Manchester City,Chelsea,"Manchester City would surely finish off Chelsea’s title challenge if they beat them, as each would have 16 games remaining but the champions a 13-point advantage. Pep Guardiola has further Covid cases to contend with, though the manager has not revealed who they are. Thomas Tuchel is rated highly by Guardiola and, after Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat in the reverse fixture, Tuchel’s plan to turn the champions over on their own turf should fascinate.

Arsenal,Burnley,"Arsenal have no excuses if their dismal form in cups continues in the league against Burnley. Mikel Arteta’s side may have struggled recently but they face a team bottom with only one win, recovering from numerous Covid cases and missing their best player, Maxwel Cornet. The Ivorian is into the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations with his country and his absence leaves Sean Dyche’s goal-shy side alarmingly short in attack. Arsenal may have shortcomings of their own thanks to the folly of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey receiving red cards in successive Carabao Cup matches against Liverpool but if they fail to return to winning ways on Sunday then the dream of returning to the Champions League could start to fade.

Brentford,Wolves,Wolves have arguably been the surprise package in the Premier League this seasonand a fourth victory in five league games for Bruno Lage’s side at Brentford would raise hopes of challenging for a European place. Wolves’ form has been built on a solid defence – conceding three in their past nine league games – and they will fancy their chances of another clean sheet against a Brentford side that have been struggling in attack with four goals in their past seven matches.

Everton,Aston Villa,"The second caretaker coming of Duncan Ferguson has turned what would have been a toxic occasion under Rafael Benítez, and a gift for Aston Villa, into one of eager anticipation among Evertonians but a formidable task awaits the Scot all the same. He leads a team devoid of confidence after one win in 13 matches against improving opponents managed by someone well versed in spoiling the mood at Goodison Park, Steven Gerrard, and who has Lucas Digne and Philippe Coutinho at his disposal for good measure. As Chelsea discovered in Ferguson’s only previous home game, however, a raucous Goodison can inspire.

Wolves,Southampton,"Southampton were excellent in their 4-1 stroll past Brentford and will arrive confident they can continue their rise up the table with another win at Molineux. However, Wolves are also enjoying a nice run of form and will hope Roman Saïss’s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations does not harm their ironclad defence. Only 14 goals conceded after 19 games is remarkable and Manchester City are the sole side who have a better record, with 13. Ralph Hasenhüttl will be meticulously planning how to break his opponents down and he can focus his side on this task as Wolves’ achilles heel is a lack of creativity. They have also scored only 14 goals and again only one side beat their tally, Norwich with eight.

Liverpool,Brentford,"Albert Stubbins, the only footballer to feature on the cover of the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s album, scored the winner when Liverpool last hosted Brentford at Anfield in the league. That was in October 1946. Seventy-six years on, Jürgen Klopp takes charge of Liverpool for the 350th time boasting the highest win percentage (60.74%) of any manager in the club’s league history. With Manchester City or Chelsea, or both, guaranteed to drop points when they meet on Saturday, Klopp will be desperately seeking an improvement on Thursday’s display against Arsenal to take advantage.

West Ham,Leeds,"West Ham regained fourth place by beating Norwich on Wednesday and will hope to continue their winning run when they host Leeds. They saw them off in the FA Cup last week and Marcelo Bielsa’s side, who are eight points above the bottom three, still have a long injury list. Bielsa will hope Patrick Bamford and Rodrigo are back to lift his side’s attacking threat. West Ham, meanwhile, are sweating on Mark Noble and Tomas Soucek, with Kurt Zouma also pushing for a place on the bench.

Aston Villa,Manchester United,The extent of the problems Ralf Rangnick has inherited at Manchester United need to be put in perspective. The fortunate 1-0 win over Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Monday was the latest example of how disjointed the team are but also meant United have lost once in 10 games under their interim manager. Scoring goals remains a problem but the return of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho from injury should give them more of a cutting edge. Villa will be keen to avenge their Cup defeat and Steven Gerrard is expected to give Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Digne debuts.

Leicester,Brighton,"Brendan Rodgers blamed naivety for the extraordinary way Leicester allowed victory to turn into defeat against Tottenham on Wednesday, but his team are becoming old hands at shooting themselves in the foot. There is mitigation: they have been hampered by injuries all season and are still without a raft of key players. But they still need to wise up quickly if they are to retain hope of reaching Europe. Brighton have similar ambitions and are in much better form – all they need to do is sharpen their finishing and they could add to Leicester’s woes.

Leeds,Burnley,"The bad news for Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds is that Kalvin Phillips, their England midfielder and anchor, and Liam Cooper, their captain and usually ever-present centre-half, will be absent injured until March. Patrick Bamford is set to return to the home attack, though, after hamstring trouble and, although Bielsa’s principal striker is expected to begin on the bench, he will doubtless be anxious to enter the fray and jog Sean Dyche’s memory. Bamford did not exactly see eye to eye with Burnley’s manager during a loan stint at Turf Moor and would surely revel in proving a point by scoring the winning goal.

Leeds,Newcastle,"Can Eddie Howe choreograph Newcastle’s second win of the season before their flight to Saudi Arabia for a warm-weather training camp on the Red Sea coast near Jeddah on Sunday? It will not be easy, particularly as Marcelo Bielsa knows victory would go a long way towards helping banish Leeds’ own, albeit latterly receding, relegation fears. A key subplot could involve a duel between Raphinha and Newcastle’s underrated left-back Paul Dummett, who impressed against Watford last Saturday on his return from a long-term injury.

Brentford,Aston Villa,"Steven Gerrard returns to the touchline for Aston Villa after recovering from Covid but will be without the suspended Tyrone Mings as well as the injured Leon Bailey and Marvelous Nakamba. Ezri Konsa and Ollie Watkins are set to start against their former club. Depleted Brentford, looking to avoid a fourth consecutive defeat, can expect to have more possession than the 23% they managed in their midweek loss to Manchester City.

Norwich,Everton,"If Norwich have any hope of staging an unlikely bid for survival it surely has to start with the visit of an Everton side in almost similarly dire straits. After taking five points from his first three matches, Dean Smith has presided over six consecutive Premier League defeats – failing to score a single goal. Everton have won once in their past 11 league games but Rafael Benítez will hope the signings of Nathan Patterson, Vitalii Mykolenko and Anwar El Ghazi will revitalise them along with the hoped-for returns to fitness of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Yerry Mina and Richarlison.

Southampton,Manchester City,"Manchester City have won 12 league matches in succession and, in such irresistible form, look very likely to make it 13 at Southampton. A swathe of pundits believe City need to sign a striker before the window closes and possibly this would help Pep Guardiola finally get over the line in the Champions League, but domestically they are cruising to glory without the frivolities of an out-and-out No 9. In the process they are making the rest of the top flight rather red-faced as no one seems able to stop City’s Rube Goldberg goal machine. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side will need to be supremely focussed from the off and that’s just to avoid a thrashing.

Tottenham,Arsenal,For the first time in a while more than just bragging rights are up for grabs in the north London derby. Arsenal head to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in fifth place and with genuine hope of forcing their way into the Champions League for the first time since the 2016-17 season. Tottenham sit two points behind them thanks to a run of eight league games undefeated since Antonio Conte’s appointment. Tottenham will be without Son Heung-min and Eric Dier while Granit Xhaka is suspended for Arsenal following his second red card of the season.

Chelsea,Tottenham,"The dynamic has changed before Chelsea and Tottenham meet for the third time this month. Chelsea dominated their rivals in the Carabao Cup semi-finals but Thomas Tuchel’s side have stuttered in the league and Spurs are on a high after their dramatic win at Leicester. Harry Kane is scoring again and Antonio Conte, who remains unbeaten in the league since his arrival in north London, will sense a chance to drag his old team into a battle for a place in the top four.

Chelsea,Liverpool,"After threatening a three-way title race, Chelsea and Liverpool both find themselves on the brink of dropping out of contention. Manchester City have opened up an imposing lead at the top of the table and can look on comfortably when their rivals meet at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. The champions will take some stopping from here. They have seen Liverpool pick up one point from their last two games and the signs are ominous for Chelsea. Thomas Tuchel has mounting injury problems at the back and is dealing with the fallout from Romelu Lukaku’s explosive interview.
