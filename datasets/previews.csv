Bolton Wanderers,Tottenham Hotspur,"Old Trafford, where they have not won since 1989, is famously one of Tottenham's great hoodoo grounds. But there is another part of Greater Manchester where Spurs come regularly and spectacularly to grief – the Reebok, where they have never won in the Premier League. Jermain Defoe's broken hand, sustained in the 5-0 rout of Burnley last Saturday, could force Harry Redknapp to play Peter Crouch up front, although given Bolton's physical game, the Tottenham manager might have done that anyway. His counterpart, Gary Megson, will be without Johan Elmander but buoyed by four games without defeat.

Manchester City,Hull City,"Hull's previous visit to Eastlands ended in a 5-1 rout, and Phil Brown's notorious half-time on-pitch team talk in front of the travelling fans who had just witnessed their side concede four unanswered goals. Brown will not wish his men's recent uplifting sequence of results in the Premier League to have a loss added to it, and certainly not by four goals. Mark Hughes, meanwhile, is hopeful Robinho will finally return to City's squad, though how happy the manager is to have the temperamental Brazilian back in the dressing room is moot.

Manchester City,Fulham,"Mark Hughes will have half an eye on events at Anfield when his side welcome Fulham to Eastlands. City are within touching distance of the Premier League summit and Liverpool's recent poor form will have reinforced their self-belief. Fulham were the last team to beat City at home in the league and under Roy Hodgson's stewardship have looked to improve again this term. Denied victory over Roma in the last minute on Thursday night, Fulham will be out to dampen the City fans' early-season optimism.

Sunderland,Everton,"Confidence could well be in short supply with Sunderland having managed just one win in their last nine league games and Everton one in 11. ""I'm worried, we're at the wrong end of the table,"" says David Moyes, the visiting manager, whose injury ravaged side are two points above the relegation zone. Steve Bruce remains slightly brighter. ""We're making progress,"" says Sunderland's manager.

Fulham,Tottenham Hotspur,"Teams are increasingly viewing trips to Craven Cottage with dread. Tottenham must attempt to avoid the fate that has befallen the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool to maintain their pursuit of the top four at a ground where they have not prevailed in the Premier League in seven years. Roy Hodgson's resurgent side are unbeaten in seven matches in all competitions and unbeaten at home since September, with their former Spurs Bobby Zamora and Danny Murphy ticking over impressively at present. It says everything about the Cottagers' progress this term that they are only three points off Manchester City, a side who have spent in excess of £200m and entertain serious hopes of breaking into the Champions League positions.

Blackburn Rovers,Tottenham Hotspur,"Even without organising Tottenham's secret Christmas party in Dublin, Robbie Keane might not have expected to start this game. The way in which Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch combined to overwhelm Manchester City should convince Harry Redknapp to keep faith with his English strike pairing. Tottenham, who have failed to win at Ewood Park in their last four attempts, are in need of a convincing away display – they have only forced one league win outside White Hart Lane since overcoming West Ham in August.

Birmingham City,West Ham United,"This is a meeting between clubs travelling in very different directions. Birmingham are enjoying their best start to a Premier League season and are looking for a fourth successive win to cement their place in the top half while West Ham continue to concede goals at an alarming rate and hover precariously above the relegation zone. Alex McLeish's side are set to be unchanged following their victory over Wigan. West Ham, meanwhile, should have Robert Green available to provide some experience to a porous defence.

Birmingham City,Manchester City,"Not a day for Birmingham City fans to be boasting about their riches. The £40m that Carson Yeung has pledged to make available to Alex McLeish in January is a drop in the ocean compared to the sums that Manchester City's owners have spent. City, however, have stuttered of late, with their last three league matches all ending as draws. Birmingham will also take encouragement from their much-needed victory over Sunderland last Saturday and the defensive lapses that have seen City fail to keep a clean sheet since the end of August.

Stoke City,Portsmouth,"Perhaps Sky should have considered dropping the 'Super' prefix of their live Sunday package when pairing this game with Bolton v Blackburn but an apathetic audience should not overlook the importance that this fixture holds for either side. Last month Pompey were encouraged by their 4-0 Carling Cup win over Stoke but this time the home side's manager, Tony Pulis, should hold the whip hand against his struggling former employers, even if he chooses to omit his fatigued Ireland players Liam Lawrence and Glenn Whelan.

Portsmouth,Manchester United,"Rarely are Manchester United not the focus ahead of one of their fixtures but the appointment of Avram Grant as Portsmouth's fourth manager in 13 months has clearly shifted the spotlight away from the champions. The Israeli is seeking what would only be Pompey's fourth win of the season and so United are hardly ideal first opponents. Grant can, though, see this game as a chance to seek revenge for Chelsea's 2008 Champions League final defeat when he came within a John Terry penalty of landing the trophy.

Manchester City,Stoke City,"There could be no better test as Roberto Mancini's first game as Manchester City manager, since failure to beat the likes of Burnley, Bolton and Hull was the principal reason Mark Hughes lost his job. Mancini was asked pointedly at his first press conference how he intended to deal with Rory Delap to test his knowledge of Stoke's style of play. Given that Manchester City's expensively-assembled defence has conceded nine times in their last three matches, there is considerable room for improvement. Up front Mancini may feel under pressure to restore Robinho and Emmanuel Adebayor, both discarded by Hughes in his final game.

Wolverhampton Wanderers,Birmingham City,"If Mick McCarthy is not to repeat the hopeless fight against relegation he endured at Sunderland, much will depend on the next three fixtures at Molineux, where Wolves face Birmingham, Bolton and Burnley, because there is unlikely to be much comfort on the road. After a 4-0 battering at Chelsea, Wolves will travel to White Hart Lane, Old Trafford and Anfield. Their record signing, striker Kevin Doyle, should return against a Birmingham side that has taken eight points from four games, although manager Alex McLeish is aware that only Portsmouth have scored fewer goals.

Arsenal,Blackburn Rovers,"Sam Allardyce is unlikely to make the same mistake he did last season, when Blackburn were uncharacteristically timid and let Arsenal pick them off. With the Gunners averaging three goals per game in the Premier League the Emirates crowd can expect a more abrasive resistance from Rovers of the type that so unnerved them when Allardyce was at Bolton. Patience may again be required for Wenger's men and Theo Walcott will be desperate to get in on the act for what would be his first appearance of the season.

Stoke City,West Ham United,"For Gianfranco Zola it's a question of when does a bad run become a crisis? The West Ham manager has not seen his side win in the league since the opening day and witnessed them keep only two clean sheets so far this campaign. The Italian has plenty to ponder, then, as he travels to the Potteries. Stoke, meanwhile, are comfortably ensconced in mid-table and will look to exploiting any uncertainty in the Hammers defence. They, however, will have to be wary of Carlton Cole, who has already scored four times this season.

West Ham United,Burnley,"Burnley will be hoping to secure a first win at Upton Park in over 30 years and will be encouraged by the news that West Ham captain Matthew Upson will be unavailable after suffering a hamstring strain in training. Danny Gabbidon is now fully fit after an abdominal injury and should step into the gap for Gianfranco Zola's side, who have won only one league match since the opening day of this season. Burnley manager Owen Coyle has no new fitness concerns and is likely to stick with the same side that drew with Aston Villa last week.

Everton,Tottenham Hotspur,Victory over AEK Athens in midweek gave David Moyes the perfect PR opportunity to spin Everton's second win in 12 matches as the turning point of a miserable season. He declined by virtue of common sense. Qualification for the knockout phase of the Europa League came at a cost of three more injuries and Everton must call on either Shane Duffy or Seamus Coleman – with a grand total of nine minutes experience in the Premier League between them – should Joseph Yobo fail to recover from a hamstring strain against an exuberant Tottenham Hotspur team unbeaten at Goodison Park since April 2004.

Liverpool,Manchester City,"This is a fixture with the potential to reinforce the impression that there are changes afoot in the make-up of the elite, with Manchester City intent on breaking into the top four. There is, however, a lot of work still to be done by a team that has drawn five Premier League games in a row after winning five of their first six. Conversely, Liverpool have players like Steven Gerrard and Alberto Aquilani nearing full fitness and the side is just three points short of fourth place despite their unconvincing recent run of form.

Wolverhampton Wanderers,Aston Villa,"Aston Villa have made their best start to a season for 10 years and make the short trip to Molineux in confident mood following last Saturday's win over Chelsea. Wolves have failed to beat their neighbours in 14 matches, dating back to 1980, but Mick McCarthy's side can take comfort from the fact that both of Villa's defeats in the league this season have come against teams in the bottom half.

Phil Brown's first ever top-flight victory came over Fulham, but a lot has changed since then. Despite a much-needed victory over Wigan, Hull still sit in the bottom three and will need to shore up the worst defensive record in the Premier League if they are to avoid the relegation worries that engulfed them last season.

Bolton have won one of their six home matches while Blackburn have lost all five away from Ewood Park. Both encounters between these sides ended level last season and a repeat result is far from inconceivable.

The hosts may be forced to sell their best players to pay off their debts while Portsmouth, who are not without financial dilemmas of their own, could lose several players to the African Cup of Nations. West Ham will look to build on the point they picked up at top of the table Chelsea last time out but they must stop leaking goals at home if they are to have any chance of pulling away from the relegation zone.

Liverpool,Arsenal,"Liverpool's involvement in this season's Champions League has now ended and the time has come to prove that they have the means to quickly return to the top four. They will be aided by Fernando Torres' return to fitness, but Arsenal, having sent a shadow squad to meet Olympiakos in midweek ought to be fresh. This, too, is an opportunity to defy those who cannot accept the club as credible contenders for the title.

Bottom of the league with zero points, so impoverished that they cannot even pay wages to their players and now having to deal with their owner, Sulaiman al-Fahim, being in hospital, Portsmouth's supporters must be wondering when the misery will end.

Tottenham Hotspur,Wolverhampton Wanderers,"Looks a straightforward home win for Tottenham against a Wolves team whose defence is still struggling to come to terms with the demands of the Premier League. Spurs, however, are just as leaky at the back – between them the teams have kept three clean sheets in the league this season – so Mick McCarthy's side may get a goal or two.

Aston Villa entered the new season concerned that they would fail to make the Europa League but having won their last four matches, including a 1-0 triumph at Old Trafford, they are now well ensconced in the Champions League places.

Wigan beat Chelsea in their last match and Roberto Martínez could be forgiven for sensing that City might be vulnerable to another upset given the list of possible absentees, including Robinho, Kolo Touré and the in-form Craig Bellamy.

City expect to welcome back two absentees from the goalless draw at Birmingham, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Touré, who together cost £41m, which is £38m more than Burnley paid for Stephen Fletcher, their record signing.

A major concern, however, is the loss of top-scorer Carlton Cole, who has a hamstring strain, but Everton have injury concerns of their own and come into this fixture on the back of a particularly poor run – David Moyes's men have not won any of their past seven fixtures in all competitions.

Chelsea,Everton,"Carlo Ancelotti described the midweek draw with Apoel Nicosia as the worst performance of his reign and since it came on the back of defeat at Manchester City, Chelsea's two-point lead at the top of the Premier League is looking more precarious than it should given the problems that have beset the other title contenders. Everton, though, have problems of their own, with last weekend's spirited draw with Tottenham barely concealing a glut of injuries and a general lack of confidence within David Moyes' squad.

Everton,Liverpool,"For so long divided, now the Merseyside rivals are united by misery. That there is little else at stake but managerial reputations exposes the depressed state of football in the city. Between them these sides have won just three of their last 21 matches in all competitions, and they arrive at Goodison Park on the back of a humiliation at Hull (Everton), out of the Champions League (Liverpool) and with no new stadium on the horizon (both). At least for Rafael Benítez there are signs of progress with injuries, and he would be well-advised not to mention his misfortune with them within earshot of David Moyes.

Liverpool,Aston Villa,"Despite their 4-0 win over Stoke, Liverpool remain a club rocking on its heels following the departure of Xabi Alonso and a clutch of injuries that has left the squad looking bare. But after the opening day defeat at White Hart Lane, another reversal so soon into the new season is unthinkable. It helps, then, that they are facing a side that has lost its last two games and failed to score on either occasion.

Wigan Athletic,Fulham,"Matches between these sides tend to produce very few goals and with the Wigan manager, Roberto Martínez, claming his side are ""light up front"" this may be another barren meeting. Fulham will be looking to put Thursday's Europa League disappointment behind them and recapture the form that saw them beat Liverpool 3-1 in their last Premier League outing.

Another concern for West Ham fans is that Gianfranco Zola's side has been playing well without getting the results, and with relegation likely to mean financial meltdown for each of these clubs, they badly need to leave Humberside with at least a point.

This is a side capable of beating Arsenal one week, drawing at Old Trafford the next, but also of losing at Wigan or Birmingham. Fulham will provide stern opposition even after the distraction of a midweek Europa League win, with the Cottagers unbeaten on home territory since September.

The visitors' task may be made even tougher by the return of Burnley's captain Steven Caldwell, who missed the start of the season with a groin complaint.

Bolton also made a poor start at home to Sunderland but their new signings Sean Davis, Paul Robinson, Zat Knight and Sam Ricketts give them scope for improvement while Brown will be hoping the American striker Jozy Altidore, available after visa problems, can give his toothless Tigers some bite up front.

Hull City,Blackburn Rovers,"One of the reasons Hull have improved in recent weeks is because their manager, Phil Brown, is spending more time coaching and less in the media, according to the City chairman, Adam Pearson. Unfortunately for the Tigers, an even bigger reason for their resurgence, Jimmy Bullard, is crocked again and is likely to be replaced by Seyi Olofinjana.

Fulham,Bolton Wanderers,"Bolton have yet to win a Premier League match at Fulham, something they do not look best-placed to change having taken three points from their last five matches. Goals have been the problem – Johan Elmander has scored just once while Kevin Davies, who scored 12 in the league last season, has only two so far this time around. He does, though, have a staunch supporter in Roy Hodgson, who paid £7m to bring him to Blackburn in 1998.

Not the best of times, then, to meet a Stoke side adding a touch of style to their pragmatism. On their previous visit to north London, Tony Pulis's team withstood a prolonged barrage from Tottenham before grabbing a late winner and they will seek to punish Arsenal on the break.

A point, Martínez felt, did not reflect their domination but he hopes to ""take the good things"" into this game, such as the competitiveness of Hendry Thomas and Mohamed Diame, both in the league's top five tacklers.

Although Hull are no Fulham, who beat Sir Alex Ferguson's side 3-0, they will see an opportunity. The home team are just above the relegation zone but that ought to make them all the keener to grasp any opportunity presented to them.

Birmingham City,Sunderland,"Steve Bruce returns to St Andrew's with a Sunderland side in buoyant mood after victory over Liverpool. Bruce hopes to prove a point to his former club after his acrimonious departure in 2007, and with Darren Bent in sparkling form atop the division's scoring charts, stands every chance of gaining a second win over the Blues this term. In the first home game since Carson Yeung's arrival as Birmingham president, he will be watching from the stands as Alex McLeish seeks to heal their defensive frailty and keep their first clean sheet since August.

Liverpool,Wolverhampton Wanderers,"The criticism Mick McCarthy attracted for his rotation policy must have left Rafael Benítez pining for the good old days. The time when the Liverpool manager was condemned merely for tinkering is long gone, and after the gutless showing at Portsmouth this is a test of his team's commitment as well as quality. Aston Villa and Tottenham follow in the league for Liverpool and they cannot afford to lose further ground in the pursuit of fourth place. McCarthy's selection at Anfield may provide another verdict on Liverpool's season.

Wolverhampton Wanderers,Arsenal,"It is 30 years since Wolves defeated Arsenal and few will give Mick McCarthy's side much chance of bringing that run to an end. Arsenal are in scintillating form, having passed a half century of goals for the season against Alkmaar on Wednesday, and won five out of their last six in the Premier League. Arsène Wenger will be without the injured Gaël Clichy and Nicklas Bendtner, while Sylvan Ebanks-Blake returns to the Wolves forward line in place of the injured Chris Iwelumo after dropping to the bench against Stoke last Saturday.

Manchester City,Wolverhampton Wanderers,"These are truly glorious times for the new and improved Manchester City. Having beaten Blackburn last week, Mark Hughes' side then overcame Barcelona at Camp Nou on the same night local rivals United were losing at Burnley. But City being City, there remains every chance they will slip-up against a newly promoted side in front of their fans. Wolves also arrive at Eastlands buoyed by their midweek win at Wigan – their first ever away victory in the Premier League. Carlos Tevez should make his full debut for the hosts.

Arsenal,Hull City,"Hull achieved one of the shocks of last season when they triumphed 2-1 at the Emirates in September 2008. A repeat seems highly unlikley as Hull's away form has been wretched in 2009 and they are without midfield dynamo Jimmy Bullard, whose troublesome knee threatens to derail any attempts to climb the table. Arsenal are not entirely without problems of their own, however; after scoring 36 goals in their first 11 games, they have manged just five in five without Robin van Persie who picked up an injury on international duty.

Portsmouth,Burnley,"Avram Grant is growing tired of the hypothetical. He and his squad face ongoing concerns regarding their pay and whether there will be money or even the dispensation to sign players in January, but they should know how important this fixture is to their hopes of staying in the Premier League. ""They are proud players and no sportsman would want to be [bottom of the league] – with money or without,"" said Grant. Burnley are in better shape but cannot afford to speculate on their own survival while their away form is so poor.

Wigan Athletic,Bolton Wanderers,"Bolton arrive at the DW Stadium outside the relegation zone after the midweek win over West Ham and the manager, Gary Megson, is determined to hold on to his best players in January to stay out of trouble. The high-scoring defender Gary Cahill, for one, is not leaving: ""There are players here who are untouchable,"" Megson said yesterday. Wigan are without Mohamed Diamé, ever-present so far, because of a knee ligament injury while Megson is likely to replace the suspended Fabrice Muamba with Chris Basham.

Blackburn Rovers,Stoke City,"Surviving for three years is the key to Premier League longevity, according to Stoke manager Tony Pulis, and his hard-working, no-frills Potters are already looking a safe bet to make it safely to the end of year two. That some supporters would like to see the team play with a touch more style, and ideally feature Tuncay Sanli from the start, is unlikely to affect the Welshman's thinking as he seeks to bring to an end Blackburn's run of five successive home victories. Captain Abdoulaye Faye returns after suspension and should go straight back into the side.

Arsenal,Tottenham Hotspur,"Robbie Keane's belief that Tottenham have a squad that is at least the equal of Arsenal's smacked of boldness if not delusion. In their most recent trip to meet one of the Champions League clubs, his team were beaten 3-0 by Chelsea. Tottenham have not defeated Arsenal in almost a decade, a run of 19 matches without a win over their north London rivals. The clubs, however, are now adjacent in the table and an attacker such as Keane must believe he can exploit weaknesses in Arsène Wenger's line-up .

Portsmouth,Tottenham Hotspur,"Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar join Harry Redknapp and his coaching staffin what is likely to be a fractious reunion on the south coast. The hosts, buoyed by their latest takeover and their first points of the season, could conceivably hoist themselves from the foot with a win, but Spurs are third and potent even on their travels these days. The corresponding fixture was won courtesy of goals from Defoe and Crouch last season. Pompey must ensure that scenario is not repeated if they are to leave Redknapp defeated and deflated.
